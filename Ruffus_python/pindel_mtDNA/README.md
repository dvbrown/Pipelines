# Idenitfying deletions from mitochondrial DNA

Mitochondrial DNA is different ot genomic DNA in many respects. An individual cell can have many mitochondiral genomes with different genotypes. 
This makes tradiitional structural variant tools less than ideal.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

You will need:
A python installtion
The ruffus pipeline library for python "http://www.ruffus.org.uk/"
The pandas library for manipulating tables in python "http://pandas.pydata.org/"
Pindel "http://gmt.genome.wustl.edu/packages/pindel/"
GATK "https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/"

### Installing

The pipeline code is available from github. Copy and paste this command if you have github command line tool installed: 
"git clone https://github.com/dvbrown/Pipelines/tree/master/Ruffus_python/160306_mtDNApipelines"
Alternatively you can use the github website and clone to your computer using a graphical user interface.

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Configuring global parameters
The paths to various software need to be set at the very top of the pindel commands


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

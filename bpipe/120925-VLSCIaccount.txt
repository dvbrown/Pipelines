If your project uses the Intel clusters (called Bruce and Merri), please read:

Our records indicate that you are now in more that one project.  To manage disk quota and CPU accounting between projects, we recommend that you use the VLSCI website to change your default project.
To change your default project, login to the VLSCI website:  select "My Projects" and click "Make default" next to the project you want to login under.
You need to do this the first time you login to a new project so a new home directory will be set-up for you.

For more information see: http://www.vlsci.org.au/documentation/pcffaqs under "I am in two (or more) different projects. How do I handle that ?"

	Hi Dan
	
	I've created a new project on merri 'VR0238' with 10TB data storage
	for the neuroblastoma transcriptomics project, and made you a member
	(the only member at this stage).
	
	To run jobs you'll need to specific the project group 'VR0002' in your
	PBS scripts as VR0238 is a subproject of VR0002. See the VLSCI docs on
	running jobs for more info:
	http://www.vlsci.org.au/documentation/x86-queueing-systems
	
	Specify the VR0002 quota in a PBS script like this:
	#PBS -A VR0002
	
	Also use the terri queue if you can - this is a dedicated LSCC 32 core
	machine so your jobs should run quicker, and if terri is full then
	jobs automatically get pushed to merri anyway.
	Specify the terri queue in a PBS script like this:
	#PBS -q terri
